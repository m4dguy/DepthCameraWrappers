Custom wrappers for interfacing depth cameras with OpenCV.
Kinect v1, Kinect v2 and others are supported.
Each wrapper uses the respective official SDK to access the camera data.
Consider this early development. Feel free to contact me for feedback.

OpenNI is not required. Use these wrappers if you:

*want to keep depencies in your project light

*want to avoid OpenNI or custom drivers

*don't have the time or patience to compile OpenCV with adapted settings
